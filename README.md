name based o random race and gender.  All the names are copied from the
Players Handbook.

It also adds a random class, alignment, and background.

There is also a website for this tool, running at
http://random-5e-npc.herokuapp.com . This project contains everything you need
to deploy it to your own Heroku domain. It runs with website.py, and is powered

## TODO

This config-driven monstrosity is hitting its limits for its current level of
structure. This thing needs some proper objects.
